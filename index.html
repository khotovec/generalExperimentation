        <p id="firstPara">This is some sample text to take up space while I experiment with divs, html nav and javascript content replacement! With this, I hope to learn how to use DOM commands much better and manipulate page content more completely through javascript. The goal is to produce an entire basic website with one page, controlled entirely with the javascript.</p>
        <h2 id="secondTitle">MONEY MONEY MONEY MONEY</h2>
        <p id="secondPara">It's unlikely, but it's a means to an end. To be subjected to the unreal and unbelievable taxation of my mind. And the city that sloped down to the river was engulfed in blackness. It removed my last vestige of trust in my own conciousness.</p>
